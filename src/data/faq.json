    "question": "What kind of video AI tools can I use with these prompts?",
    "answer": "The English-language cinematic descriptions are optimized for leading text-to-video models like Google's Veo, OpenAI's Sora, RunwayML, and Pika Labs. They are designed to be descriptive and specific to get the best visual results."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I request changes to a generated scene?",
    "answer": "Yes! Each scene card has options to regenerate, copy, or delete. When you regenerate a scene, you can provide specific feedback to the AI to guide the changes, allowing you to iterate on your story with precision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do I get two versions of the script if I use a non-English prompt?",
    "answer": "Most advanced video AI models are primarily trained on English. To ensure the highest quality video output, we provide a hyper-detailed English version optimized for those models. We also provide the script in your original language for your reference and creative use."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a limit to the number of scenes I can generate?",
    "answer": "You can generate up to 5 scenes at a time. This allows the AI to create a coherent short story arc with a beginning, middle, and end. For longer projects, you can generate multiple sets of scenes."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does character consistency work?",
    "answer": "The 'Master Scene Template' generated by the AI creates a rulebook for character appearance, clothing, and mannerisms. The AI then uses this rulebook to ensure your characters look and feel consistent from one scene to the next, which is crucial for storytelling."
