## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark orange (#FF8C00) to suggest creativity and intelligence. A dynamic color system will allow changing this and other colors from a central location.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#22222A), almost black, to highlight content. Controlled by the dynamic color system.
- Accent color: Bright pink (#f40752) to draw attention to key elements and interactive buttons. Controlled by the dynamic color system.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly techy look.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure excellent readability and a clean design.
- Use minimalist icons to represent options and controls.
- Subtle, non-distracting transitions between form elements.
